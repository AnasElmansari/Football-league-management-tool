# Football-league-management-tool
This C program is a football league management tool that processes match data, calculates team statistics, ranks teams based on performance, and displays the standings. It uses two primary data structures: the `Kamp` struct, which stores match details such as date, time, teams, goals scored, and attendance, and the `Hold` struct, which holds team statistics, including name, points, goals scored, and goals conceded. The program begins by reading match data from a file (`kampe-2024-2025.txt`) using the `indlaesKampe` function. Each match entry is then processed in the `opdaterHold` function, which updates the points and goals for the home and away teams based on the match outcome (3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss). The `findEllerTilføjHold` function ensures that each team is either found in or added to the team list. Once all matches are processed, the `sorterHold` function uses `qsort` to rank teams by points and goal difference, ensuring a proper leaderboard. Finally, the `udskrivStillingen` function prints a table showing the teams’ names, points, goals scored, and goals conceded in a readable format. For example, if the input file contains matches like `TeamA - TeamB 2-1` and `TeamC - TeamA 1-1`, the program calculates statistics and outputs standings with `TeamA` leading due to 4 points, followed by `TeamC` with 1 point and `TeamB` with 0 points. This program efficiently manages football league data, offering a clear view of team performance and rankings.
